# StethoFuse

A cardiopulmonary sound-separation application for research and education, with a calm
winter workspace for recordings, separation runs and explicitly shared audio review.
**Not a diagnostic system.** The M1 application is deployed at
[stethofuse.ashraf-alsaloul.com](https://stethofuse.ashraf-alsaloul.com).
The 15 October user-readiness release includes the Frost/Midnight public home,
genuine owl arrival, private profile photos, metadata export, confirmed account
deletion and in-app updates. Read the [current live release evidence](docs/USER_READINESS_LIVE_20261015.md).
The frozen CPU separator is connected; ensemble execution remains unavailable.
The [27 September receipt](deploy/PRODUCTION_2026-09-27.md) is historical evidence.

Academic project: **Machine Learning-Based System for Cardiopulmonary Sound Separation**.
The application and FYP report remain separate Git repositories. Submitted FYP1 evidence
is preserved in the sibling documentation repository.

## Current milestone

M1 connects Firebase identity to FastAPI authorization and private, persistent user data.
The approved frontend/artwork and continuous two-axis owl renderer are preserved.
Read [the M1 API contract](docs/M1_API_CONTRACT.md) and
[route protection evidence](docs/M1_ROUTE_AUDIT.md) for exact scope and limitations.

| Layer | Technology / boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Interface | React19, TypeScript, Vite, React Router; existing winter/glass design |
| Identity | Official Firebase Web SDK; email/password and Google flows |
| Authorization | FastAPI + trusted application SQLite records; verified Firebase UID |
| Private data | Explicit development database and private filesystem, outside public assets |
| Media | Authorized API delivery; no public upload/output/visualization mount |
| ML/evaluation | Preserved Python Strategy/Factory services, PyTorch NeoSSNet adapter and individual baselines |
| Testing | Pytest API/permission integration and real Chrome browser automation; mocks distinguished from live providers |

Live identity cannot be inferred from a successful build or mock test. The selected project
`stethofuse-c18cd-3cca0` has its registered Web App and enabled email/password and Google
providers. Developer CLI consent, restricted keyless backend ADC and harmless provider
reads are verified. On 27 September 2026, real Google-authenticated sessions for the
verified primary Administrator and an existing Healthcare Staff account were accepted by
the local FastAPI verifier. Admin Users returned 200 to the Administrator and 403 to Staff;
Staff also received 403 when submitting a forged admin-role request. A synthetic silent WAV
verified owner access, exact-resource sharing, direct-media/download denial before sharing,
and denial again immediately after revocation. A second Staff-owned silent fixture returned
403 to the Administrator for metadata, media and download and remained absent from the
Admin recording list. This is **LOCAL REAL PROVIDER** plus **LOCAL BACKEND** evidence, not
production verification. Email/password and recovery flows remain untested, and no
verification/reset email was sent. No Firebase project is created automatically.

The deployed identity boundary uses local Firebase ID-token signature/claim verification
plus Firebase Auth REST `accounts:lookup` for current-user/revocation checks, followed by
trusted local authorization. The separate server key is restricted to Identity Toolkit.
Cloud Run was superseded before deployment; no Google Cloud billing was enabled.
Production Google Admin/Staff requests now return Admin API 200/403 respectively, and
private-media access is denied to non-owners (including an Administrator without a grant).
These newer checks are **PRODUCTION + REAL FIREBASE**, recorded separately from the
earlier local share/revoke evidence above.

## Identity and access

```text
Firebase sign-in → current ID token → Authorization: Bearer → FastAPI verification
  → UID-linked application account → active status + role + owner/grant check → resource
```

- Public registration defaults to `healthcare_staff`; no requested browser role is accepted.
- `audio_analyst` can review only explicitly assigned resources.
- `admin` manages accounts and safe operational metadata, not everyone's private audio.
- The current administrator's own User Management row is read-only: FastAPI rejects
  self role/status changes with `403`; another administrator must act, and the last-active
  administrator safeguard remains enforced.
- First-admin bootstrap is a trusted operator action against a real, verified UID, never an
  email match, first-user promotion, browser toggle or public HTTP endpoint.
- Role/status/grant checks use trusted records; UI guards only support navigation.
- Legacy unowned data stays quarantined. No automatic ownership inference or destructive
  database migration is performed on startup.
- Demo personas and synthetic audio are development-only and isolated from live mode.

See [roles, signup/sign-in and administrator provisioning](docs/ROLES_AND_ACCOUNT_PROVISIONING.md)
for the permission matrix, steps for promoting another verified account and FYP2 use-case actors.
The user confirmed that an existing administrator may promote additional administrators;
public signup still never grants privileged roles.

The development branch is `fyp2/application`; its Git history and the earlier
`codex/fyp2-application-rebuild` branch remain preserved.
Its author configuration matches the existing human-authored repository identity
`ASHRAF-2004 <adoashraf103@gmail.com>` and the authenticated GitHub account. The earlier
`codex/fyp2-application-rebuild` remote branch remains preserved. Its duplicate draft PR #8
was closed as superseded by owner-maintained draft PR #9; no history was rewritten. The
normal branch is pushed for review, not merged to main.
The production application release is `921c40d`; later operational documentation commits
do not imply a new application-image deployment. Main remains unmerged.

## Local development (Ubuntu)

Reuse installed dependencies. This repository does not require reinstallation of the working
frontend, Blender or ML stack to test authentication. From this repository:

```sh
# Existing frontend: normal mode is live and fails closed if configuration is absent.
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4180 --strictPort
```

Copy `frontend/.env.example` to an ignored local configuration only after obtaining the
existing project's genuine Web App settings. Firebase web configuration is public client
configuration; Firebase Admin credentials and OAuth secrets must never go into `VITE_*`.
The prepared workspace already has its genuine configuration in ignored `frontend/.env.local`.
Use **http://localhost:4180/login** for local provider tests: `localhost` is currently an
authorized Firebase domain; `127.0.0.1` is not. The production hostname is now authorized.
Use the existing provider auth domain, not an invented callback URL. No email is sent by tests
without an explicitly designated recipient.

The API-only dependencies are pinned in `requirements-m1.txt`. The prepared workspace uses
`../.local/venvs/backend-smoke/`; a standalone checkout may use its own ignored virtualenv.

```sh
# Prepared workspace environment, not system Python:
../.local/venvs/backend-smoke/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-m1.txt

# Explicit isolated paths, never the legacy database or frontend public directory:
export STETHOFUSE_M1_DATABASE=/home/ashraf/Documents/StethoFuse/.local/data/m1.sqlite3
export STETHOFUSE_M1_PRIVATE_STORAGE=/home/ashraf/Documents/StethoFuse/.local/private-storage/m1
export STETHOFUSE_FIREBASE_PROJECT=stethofuse-c18cd-3cca0
/home/ashraf/Documents/StethoFuse/.local/venvs/backend-smoke/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --no-access-log
```

The API runtime does not use Firebase Admin ADC. It verifies Firebase ID-token signatures
locally using Google's public signing certificates, then calls Firebase Auth REST
`accounts:lookup` with the same token to check current UID, disabled/email-verification
state and the revocation boundary. The server API key is restricted only to Identity
Toolkit; it is not an Admin credential. Role, status, ownership and sharing remain enforced
by trusted local backend storage. Cloud Run was superseded before deployment due to the
Google Cloud billing prepayment requirement; no billing was enabled. See
`../planning/PRODUCTION_RUNTIME_PROPOSAL.md` for current acceptance status. Never substitute
browser roles or local state for this boundary, and never copy developer ADC or credentials
into Compose.

The trusted first-admin bootstrap is a separate operator-only CLI path in
`scripts/bootstrap_m1_admin.py` and `app/m1/bootstrap_provider.py`. It uses a separately
authorized local ADC session only when explicitly invoked with `--apply`; those credentials
are not API runtime credentials and must not be copied into Docker or backups. Existing
bootstrap is complete; do not rerun it as setup.

Explicit fictional preview (development server only):

```sh
cd frontend
VITE_APP_MODE=demo npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4181 --strictPort
```

## Checks and evidence

```sh
cd frontend
npm run build

# From repository root; isolated temporary databases/private files and mock identity:
/home/ashraf/Documents/StethoFuse/.local/venvs/backend-smoke/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_access_foundation.py tests/test_m1_api.py tests/test_m1_operator_safety.py -q
```

Use the exact test filenames/commands recorded in the route audit if additional suites are
added. **MOCK** proves application behavior against controlled identities, not successful
Google login or Firebase project configuration. **EMULATOR**, **LOCAL REAL PROVIDER** and
**PRODUCTION** results must be separately identified. The commands above are local tests;
the deployment receipt identifies the actual production checks.

From `frontend/`, the focused live-client tests are `node tests/m1/client.mjs` and
`node tests/m1/browser.mjs` (running loopback Vite required). `node tests/m1/cross-layer.mjs`
starts an ephemeral loopback FastAPI instance with temporary SQLite/private files and
exercises actual browser upload/media/isolation using **mock identity only**. Test SDK
substitutions live under `tests/`, not in an application login bypass. Use a new
`EVIDENCE_ROOT` for repeat runs; evidence is never silently overwritten.

## Separation and research provenance

The normal workflow requests **one ensemble separation**, not a choice of individual
algorithm. Ensemble Learning remains in scope; Federated Learning is excluded.
The M1 API must report unavailable execution honestly while the verified ensemble executor
is not connected—it must not manufacture jobs, outputs or superiority scores.

| Component | Preserved implementation and evidence boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed-filter baseline | Frequency-domain baseline for controlled benchmarking |
| NMF baseline | NumPy multiplicative-update spectrogram decomposition; not a complete published NMF/NMCF reproduction |
| VMD baseline | `vmdpy` mode decomposition/grouping; not the combined DAE-NMF-VMD method |
| NeoSSNet | Existing PyTorch adapter and source reference; checkpoint identity, license and exact paper correspondence require verification |
| Ensemble | Intended expert/fusion direction; no superiority claim without appropriate experiments |

Existing training, dataset preparation and evaluation scripts remain in `scripts/` and
`evaluation/`. They are **not** run as part of M1 setup. See the preserved
[legacy baseline instructions](docs/LEGACY_BASELINE_README.md) for historical commands, not
for current public API/security instructions. Its old performance/availability statements
are historical, not newly verified results. The report's candidate attribution register is
`../documentation/fyp2/provenance/METHOD_ATTRIBUTION.md`.

Reference-based metrics require valid paired references, documented splits/alignment and
real executions. Synthetic demo waveforms are never evaluation results. Do not collect
participant/patient recordings as development fixtures.

```

Large historical render evidence and inactive frame libraries remain on disk, excluded from
new Git commits; approved runtime owl assets and source scripts are retained. No frame library
was regenerated during M1. Environment files, credentials, databases, recordings, model weights,
caches and build output are ignored. Never serve the parent workspace.

## Production-like local runtime

An isolated Docker Compose package now builds the current M1 frontend/API for local
production-like testing. It serves the SPA and `/api` through the same Caddy origin, keeps
the API unpublished to the host, and stores SQLite/private audio in external bind mounts.
It has no connection to Axora's network and does not include a separation worker or GPU
service. Follow [the deployment package runbook](deploy/README.md) for configuration,
build/run, health/auth smoke checks, backup and restore guidance.

Local validation on 27 September 2026 passed: both images built; `/` and a nested SPA route
returned 200; `/api/health` reported storage/provider configured and ensemble unavailable;
tokenless protected auth/admin/media requests returned 401; an API restart preserved
synthetic-only database/private-file state. This is local package evidence, not a production
test, a backup-recovery drill, or evidence of connected ensemble processing.

## Production deployment

**https://stethofuse.ashraf-alsaloul.com** runs on the owner's Linux server, not Firebase
Hosting. Its dedicated `stethofuse-production` tunnel reaches isolated Caddy at
`127.0.0.1:8088`; FastAPI port 8000 is internal. SQLite/private media persist under
`/srv/stethofuse`; credentials remain outside Git. Axora's routes/services were unchanged.

On 27 September 2026, HTTPS/SPA/API health, real Google Admin 200/Staff 403, private-media
isolation and restart persistence passed. The first encrypted B2 application snapshot
completed; daily backups are active with pruning disabled. The prepared consistent backup
briefly stops StethoFuse each night. Earlier synthetic restore/password-escrow verification
is separate evidence, not a claim that every production snapshot has been restored.

See [exact services, evidence, limitations and rollback](deploy/PRODUCTION_2026-09-27.md).
Email/password/recovery and real Analyst acceptance remain pending; ensemble processing,
derived results and future GPU work are not deployed. Do not collect patient data.
