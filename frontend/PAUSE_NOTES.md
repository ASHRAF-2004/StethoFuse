# Current: local continuous-forest prototype, 2026-10-28

The owner rejected the deployed forest design and requested a layered Day/Night
prototype before any replacement. Branch `feature/forest-world-prototype`, based
on `e848bb17f9fb1141990bf8079dad635684f0620f`. Production is untouched.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4192/forest-review.html`. The isolated Vite config is
`forest-prototype.vite.config.ts`; start with
`node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js --config forest-prototype.vite.config.ts`.
It binds loopback only and has no API proxy.

Read `../docs/ENCHANTED_FOREST_PROTOTYPE_REVIEW.md`, the design postmortem and owl
study there. Seven independent artwork sources form a continuous valley, tree,
deer clearing and earth footer. Existing approved owl renderer/assets are unchanged.
The separate 24 fps/96-pose anatomical study is **NOT final flight artwork**. Final
flight and its idle handoff remain unapproved and disabled in the forest scene.

Owner visual approval of composition AND final animation is required before any
landing replacement, main merge or deployment. Do not resume the rejected design
or replay old production/coordinator handoffs. Stop for owner review at this gate.

Historical checkpoints below remain as history, not current design instructions.

# M1 authentication continuation — 2026-09-26

The newer frontend is preserved in pre-M1 commit `c681839`. M1 now adds official
Firebase client authentication and protected same-origin API integration without changing
approved owl/artwork or shared theme files. Normal mode is LIVE/fail-closed if configuration
is missing; fictional personas require explicit development demo mode (`npm run dev:demo`).
Selected project `stethofuse-c18cd-3cca0` now has Web App
`1:923213197696:web:e1810085b8db2b77a2d165`; its real public configuration is in ignored
`.env.local`. Email/password and Google providers are enabled and read-verified. Local
login was inspected at **http://localhost:4180/login** with enabled controls and no missing
configuration notice. Only localhost and default Firebase domains are currently authorized.
The build passes with this configuration. The user subsequently reported successful
Google sign-in in a normal browser; official provider lookup and the UID-linked backend
account corroborate the intended identity. Embedded-browser Google sign-in failed earlier.

Developer CLI consent, restricted keyless backend ADC and primary-admin bootstrap are
complete locally. The approved primary account is now Administrator. Refresh/refocus the
normal browser tab to reload its server-owned role; no frontend or owl edits were needed.
Existing admins may promote verified accounts through Administration → Users (user-confirmed).
Real post-promotion browser checks, ordinary-account denial and email/recovery delivery remain.
Never invent config or use browser roles as
backend authority. Mock browser/API evidence is separate from real-provider verification.

See parent `PAUSE_NOTES.md`, `planning/M1_LOCAL_CHECKPOINT.md`, current repository README
and `docs/M1_API_CONTRACT.md`. Historical notes below are retained, not current blockers.
Owl is DONE/PRESERVE. No redesign, DNS, push or deployment is authorized in this checkpoint.

# Previous checkpoint — workspace preparation, 2026-09-26

Frontend and approved continuous owl preserved; no UI/assets/controller edits in this task.
Parent workspace now includes independent implementation/documentation repositories, planning,
canonical reference index, recoverable cache archive and isolated backend role scaffolding.
See `/home/ashraf/Documents/StethoFuse/PAUSE_NOTES.md` and `planning/SETUP_STATUS.md` there.

- Fresh build and 56 focused browser checks pass; 210 protected frontend/approved-art hashes unchanged.
- Existing Vite preview remains `http://127.0.0.1:4180/`. Live auth/backend integration is NOT complete.
- User explicitly cleared the old owl gate with “Animation is Done”; preserve this renderer.
  Latest homepage polish still awaits feedback. No further redesign during preparation.
- One retired offline direction-field cache was recoverably archived; source frames remain intact.
- STOP at preparation checkpoint. Await explicit authorization for the next milestone.

---

# Previous checkpoint — homepage polish, 2026-09-25

Removed the top frosted strip, tightened the two-line hero headline, and refined individual glass CTA buttons against the new supplied homepage reference. Existing owl and sign-in are unchanged. See `HOME_POLISH_REVIEW.md`.

- Preview open at `http://127.0.0.1:4180/`.
- Build passes; five fresh responsive/navigation checks and six focused regression checks pass. Final 320px headline wrap corrected and rerun. Screenshots visually inspected.
- Before/after, protected hashes, reversible source copies and test evidence: `output/playwright/home-polish/`. Login screenshot byte-identical; protected owl/logo source hashes unchanged.
- No new media, dependencies, service changes or deployment. Only homepage markup/styles changed. Await visual feedback.

---

# Previous checkpoint — public/authentication reference refresh, 2026-09-24

User requested matching the supplied lake/centered-glass sign-in reference, home winter-theme continuation, and gray-to-light-gray “signals within.”. Implemented and verified; see `PUBLIC_REFERENCE_REVIEW.md`.

- Preview: `http://127.0.0.1:4180/login` and `/`. Original reference owl pixels used on auth scenery; real form controls, approved logo unchanged. One disclosed clean-landscape reconstruction behind UI. No owl animation regeneration or controller edits.
- Home now uses the same frosted/slate-blue materials and reference decorations. Shared auth presentation covers existing recovery states. Keep the approved live18-view owl unchanged.
- Fresh checks: public42, production6, focused motion6, final responsive/layout10 passed. Build passes; screenshots and protected hashes under `evidence/public-reference/`.
- Scoped backup `evidence/public-reference/checkpoint/public-before.tar.gz`; new assets/provenance in `assets/public-reference/`, optimization script `tools/prepare_public_reference.py`. No backend/service/deployment changes.

---

# Previous checkpoint — literal reference artwork, 2026-09-24

The user rejected the loosely inspired winter-glass pass below: “Do same Owl in images and same assets. DO exactly like the images.” The current pass uses the actual decorative artwork from the supplied20 references and measured route layouts, not new substitute owl/folder/feather artwork.

- Preview remains `http://127.0.0.1:4180/app/dashboard`; fictional demo personas are available on `/login#demo-personas`. The in-app tab is left on the Elias demo dashboard.
- New source-isolated artwork framing: `ReferenceArt.tsx`, `reference-match.css`, `tools/prepare_reference_art.py`, and `assets/reference-match/manifest.json`. Updated shared UI and workspace/account/public utility layouts. All controls remain live HTML, not a screenshot facade.
- Exact standalone new art was not found. Reference decorative pixels are lossless copies with SVG viewport/clip masking. Hidden mountain background required one disclosed reconstruction. Font identity and full-screen pixel identity are not claimed.
- Approved landing owl controller, surface renderers, manifest and logo hashes remain unchanged. No backend/ML, live auth, domain, deployment or original artwork changes.
- Scoped starting backup: `evidence/reference-match/checkpoint/frontend-before.tar.gz`. Earlier work/evidence remains intact.
- Fresh focused functional checks:69PASS/0FAIL; final mobile overlap fixed and5 containment cases rerun. See `evidence/reference-match/functional/README.md`, `final/mobile/`, and the native-size screenshot set in `visual/`. Build passes. These are not user visual approval.
- See `REFERENCE_MATCH_REVIEW.md` for the exact-vs-reconstructed artwork boundary, commands, size tradeoff and evidence. Await visual feedback; no deployment or service integration.

---

# Previous checkpoint — winter-glass frontend, 2026-09-24

The user explicitly said **“Animation is Done. Now resume the front-end work”** and supplied 20 winter-glass references. The historical approval gate below is satisfied; old pause instructions are historical, not the current task state.

- Shared winter-glass design implemented across the existing app. See `WINTER_GLASS_REVIEW.md` and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
- Approved 18-view connected-neck field is the normal default. Pointer controller, Canvas fallback, source artwork and rendering math are unchanged. No source frames regenerated. Old fields remain development-only comparisons.
- Local preview: `http://127.0.0.1:4180/`; fictional personas: `/login#demo-personas`. No deployment, backend, ML, domain or real-auth changes.
- Fresh functional suites: 154 PASS, 0 FAIL. All 28 integration routes matched exact paths/headings. Mobile search and processing-row wrapping defects found visually and corrected.
- Actual composited-background contrast sample: 54 text measurements pass after corrections; not a complete accessibility certification. Performance observations and limitations: `evidence/winter-glass/quality/`.
- Reassignment preserves the old reviewer/history on a revoked assignment and creates a fresh pending ID with an empty review. Processing-job pages are owner-only; explicit recipients retain shared recording/result access.
- Starting backup: `evidence/winter-glass/checkpoint/frontend-before.tar.gz`. All 24 identity/controller/source/brand checks pass: `evidence/winter-glass/preservation.json`.
- Generated only supporting feather/frosted-folder art and one design concept. Sources/prompts in `assets/winter-glass/`; responsive copies in `public/assets/winter/`.
- Build passes. Generation, processing and test jobs finished; the existing local preview stays running. Await feedback on the redesigned frontend; do not deploy or start service integration without authorization.

# Historical owl-approval checkpoints

## Latest review checkpoint — connected neck candidate, 2026-09-24

- User reported a cut-off head during down→down-left→left. The cause was compounded static-body restoration crossing the moving lower neck, not absence of whole-body source images. See `evidence/owl-neck-continuity/REVIEW.md`.
- **Review URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4180/?owlNeck=1`** (optional `&owlDebug=1`). Normal URL retains the previous19-view field below; do not confuse it with this18-view candidate. No deployment or promotion yet.
- Candidate uses17 raw whole-body originals plus prior up-right repair. It excludes the cropped down-left repair, extends the continuous surface to900px, registers the lower torso, and preserves the fixed wing/feet. Original head pixels above500 remain untouched during source registration. One generated complete down-left validation image is saved, NOT used in the renderer.
- Final actual pointer suites:11 poses each in GPU and software Chrome151, no JS errors. GPU median/p95 changing-draw intervals16.7/16.7ms; software16.7/16.8ms. Long outliers remain. Lifecycle11PASS; buildPASS; all original source/controller/body/poster and normal manifest hashes unchanged. Real ChatGPT browser down/down-left/left interaction inspected; Canvas2D18-view ready. This does not constitute user approval.
- Evidence: `evidence/owl-neck-continuity/down-left-turn.mp4`, `sweep-before-after.png`, `final-motion-frames.png`, `after/`, `after-canvas/`, `verification.json`. Lower body pixels identical across11 captures below920. Fine feather blending remains under magnification; prior up-right occlusion issue not fully resolved by this neck-specific pass.
- Payload3,650,100bytes; decoded source RGBA75,362,400bytes plus other buffers. Software590px head cap still applies. No dependencies added.
- Rebuild candidate only with `OWL_NECK_TRIAL=1 python3 tools/build_conforming_owl.py`. Backup in `evidence/owl-neck-continuity/checkpoint/`. Do not delete either source library or promote candidate without review.
- Processing, generation and test jobs finished. Review server4180 and ChatGPT browser tab remain available. All remaining frontend work stays paused pending explicit owl approval AND authorization to continue.

## Current checkpoint — published diagonal repair, 2026-09-24

This section supersedes the older17-source renderer claims below. The user rejected that earlier output; its technical PASS results are not visual approval.

- Normal preview `http://127.0.0.1:4180/` now uses19 source views: unchanged17 originals plus two focused generated up-right/down-left intermediate repairs. Original source PNG, body and poster hashes verified against the pre-repair checkpoint.
- Corrected manually inspected eye/occlusion/beak landmarks, pupil contours where observed, broad throat bands,24 silhouette bands and pair-boundary-conforming interpolation. No sector/nearest-output-frame selection. Nominal yaw±30/pitch±18 envelope remains; not calibrated anatomy.
- Actual ChatGPT browser lacks WebGL2. `owlCanvasSurface.ts` now provides the same continuous field in software instead of leaving it static. In-app diagnostics confirm19-source Canvas ready. Real pointer paths tested in Chrome151 GPU and forced software; native in-app pointer performance not measured.
- Current field2,427,314bytes including manifest/150 required files; decoded sourceRGBA53,032,800bytes plusflow368,328/mesh291,960 and body/canvas buffers. Software head raster capped590px. No dependencies added.
- Final evidence/report: `evidence/owl-diagonal-repair/REVIEW.md`; `final-webgl/owl-motion.mp4`; `final-comparison/diagonal-before-after.png`; `published-samples/`93 sampled positions. Both final pointer suites12PASS; lifecycle11PASS; standalone software testPASS; final buildPASS. LocalChrome median changing draw16.7ms; do not extrapolate to all devices.
- Major pupil crescent and throat squeeze improved. Small angular blue-gray occlusion blend still visible at2× in up-right far pupil; inherited small neck cutout step and fine photographic texture blending remain. Do not call these pixel-perfect or final-user-approved.
- Current exporter remains `tools/build_conforming_owl.py`, now19 sources by default. `OWL_DIAGONAL_TRIAL=1` only selects candidate output folder. Reusable generated-crop registration/provenance in `assets/owl-repairs/2026-09-24/`. Scoped backup `evidence/owl-diagonal-repair/checkpoint/`. No source library deleted.
- No remaining builders, generation jobs or browser tests running. Servers4180/4181 remain. Theme/pages/backend work unchanged. Remaining frontend tasks below stay paused until explicit owl approval AND authorization to continue.

## Previous checkpoint (historical, not current acceptance evidence)

Paused on 2026-09-24 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur). Do not resume remaining frontend work until the user explicitly approves the owl and authorizes continuation.

- All agent work paused. No asset builders or browser test scripts remain running.
- Local development/preview servers remain available at ports 4180/4181.
- Existing backend/ML files were not edited; implementation git status is only untracked `frontend/`.
- Current frontend work and evidence are saved on disk. No deployment or commits made.
- The previous 1,025-frame/41×25 field was rejected. It selected a hard texture winner, rounded poses, and waited for newly requested images. Its old RAF statistics did not establish actual changing-image cadence. Preserve the old evidence, but DO NOT use those PASS claims to certify the current owl.
- Live `src/components/Owl.tsx` + `owlSurface.ts` now use continuous normalized coordinates and elapsed-time damping with a local WebGL2 multi-view surface. No sectors, output-frame rounding, currentTime seeking, or requests during movement. Keep the nominal ±30 yaw / ±18 pitch radial envelope; this is not calibrated 3D anatomy.
- Live assets: `public/assets/owl/smooth-field/manifest.json`, version 5. Seventeen existing clean source views, source-specific conforming meshes, and shared pairwise maps. The mesh follows eye/beak feature boundaries instead of cutting across them with a regular grid. The up-right inner/outer eye rims and visible pupil centres were corrected. Down-left topology/neck folds were corrected. Original shoulder, wing and lower-body pixels stay fixed under a feather-boundary mask.
- Rebuild ONLY with `python3 tools/build_conforming_owl.py`. `build_smooth_field.py` and `build_smooth_owl.py` are historical experiments/helper imports, not the current exporter. Do not regenerate the rejected regular-grid renderer.
- Required current surface transfer: 2,051,353 bytes including manifest, in 132 small files; decoded source textures 47,450,400 bytes, flow buffers 240,000 bytes, geometry 188,172 bytes, plus body/canvas/render targets. Original master, all 17 source PNGs, static body and poster hashes verified unchanged. No dependencies added and no new AI images generated in this fix.
- Final evidence: `evidence/owl-smooth-v2/browser-final-review/`. Chrome 151, hardware AMD ANGLE, headless automation: 12 focused checks PASS, no errors/warnings. Actual changing draws: 1,417 distinct poses over 23.7 seconds; median/p95 intervals 16.7/16.7 ms. This is actual draw cadence, not empty RAF timing. Latest build passed.
- Additional lifecycle suite: 11 PASS including DPI2, stationary-pointer scroll/resize remapping, CTA hover, reduced-motion toggling, loading/context-loss fallback. Tab visibility checks are simulated events, not a real-device background-tab benchmark. Desktop/tablet/mobile viewports were emulated in real Chrome; no physical mobile testing.
- Geometry: 5,616 contributor-pose build checks and 1,089 exported-mesh pose checks; zero significant visible inversions, with explicitly reported subpixel numerical residuals. This is not visual approval. Enlarged diagonal captures and consecutive actual recording frames were inspected. Fine photographic texture blending and inherited cutout-edge imperfections remain limitations under magnification.
- Scoped backups: `evidence/owl-smooth-v2/checkpoint/` and `diagonal-before/`. Unused newly generated surface trials were moved, not deleted, into `.cache/owl-smooth-field/retired/`; recovery list: `evidence/owl-smooth-v2/retired-assets.json`. Existing source libraries were not removed.
- Review report: `evidence/owl-smooth-v2/REVIEW.md`. Final motion preview: `evidence/owl-smooth-v2/browser-final-review/owl-smooth-motion.mp4`. User approval is still REQUIRED before any remaining frontend work.
- The review URL is `http://127.0.0.1:4180/`; append `?owlDebug=1` for the development target/current yaw/pitch overlay. Dev/preview servers remain available at ports 4180/4181.
- Full frontend routes/adapters/fixtures are implemented. Public42, workflows16, admin24, draft6, production-public6 and shared13 checks have passed in their recorded runs, not as a single final regression run. Final integration/build/performance reruns remain pending. Existing integration report still contains pre-fix mobile overflow failures.
- Shared fixes include draft preservation, cross-tab assignment revocation, notification preferences, latest-result ordering, modal labels, mobile drawer focus/inert handling and session-expiry navigation. Shared13 suite passed; latest admin regression was interrupted for this pause.
- Visual review found low-contrast small text in `.eyebrow`, `.breadcrumbs`, `.timestamp-note code`, `.workspace-footer`, `.auth-demo-note`, and `.form-divider`. Public agent was about to change only public CSS when interrupted; inspect the actual diff before resuming. Do not mark contrast fixed without checking.
- New documentation: FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md, FRONTEND_ROUTE_MAP.md, ASSET_OPTIMIZATION.md, PERFORMANCE.md, evidence/visual-consistency.md.
- After explicit owl approval AND authorization to continue frontend work: fix the previously noted contrast, rerun remaining frontend integration suites, and update frontend reports. Do not confuse the focused owl checks above with a fresh all-routes regression.
